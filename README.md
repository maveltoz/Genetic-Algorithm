# Genetic-Algorithm
Find the maximum value using generic algorithm

* target function

  f(x) = x^5 - 4*x^4 - 12*x^3 + 34*x^2 + 11*x - 30

* range of values

  -7 <= x <= 7

* searching

  Use GA to explore the maximum value of f(x) within a given range.

* performance

  Population Size = 500
  Iteration = 100
  Crossover Rate = 0.7
  Mutation Rate = 0.01
  
  BLUE LINE : MAX(The performance of chromosome, which achieves the highest performance in each iteration.)
  RED LINE : AVG(The average performance value of chromosomes that constitute population for each iteration.)
